### Story Level Ups
*This rule is mutually exclusive with experience leveling.*

You level up when the ST decides that a story goal has been met. He/she will inform you that it is time for a level and you will raise any stat by 1. It is recommended that you focus on stats that can be raised to 7+ due to these levels give specialized abilities.
