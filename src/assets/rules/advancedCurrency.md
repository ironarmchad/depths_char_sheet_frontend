## Advanced Currency (Kazoo)

The advanced currency (ask ST for proper name but I will call it the Kazoo) is used for items and services that actually have game impact. Generally expect that you can buy some magic items, service of trainers or even base upgrades with Kazoos. STs are warned to watch the economy of Kazoo.
